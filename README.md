# Junshen's Website

Hi, I'm Junshen (Jason) Tao and this is the github for my [website](https://jtao-site.herokuapp.com/). I built this using ReactJS, HTML, and CSS. 
In my website you will find the projects that I have completed as well as contact information on the bottom.

## TODO
- Update project images
- When clicking on projects, it would drop down all the projects
- Sort projects by year or some other time frame, time frame is shown on the right side of the screen
- Adjust scrolling so it will show new project more easily
- Include other sections into the site such as experience and education
